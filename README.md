## 🗄️ Demonstration Dataset Archival

All 45 demonstration records from the preliminary Delhi pilot have been permanently archived and clearly separated:
- `archive/delhi_demonstration_dataset.json`

## 📋 Website Status Definitions & Protocol
- **Found**: An official standalone business website (e.g., `nikbakers.com`, `cloudninecare.com`) has been identified, loaded, and verified active.
- **Not Found**: A documented multi-keyword search confirmed no standalone website exists. Third-party aggregator profiles (Zomato, Swiggy, Practo, Justdial) or unindexed social accounts alone do not count as an official website.
- **Unclear**: The listing has an unresolving domain, DNS NXDOMAIN, parked page, or ambiguous shared directory entry requiring a secondary manual audit.
